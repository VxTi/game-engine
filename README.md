### Open World Game Engine

---

This project is mainly a learning exercise for me to learn more about game engines,
and rendering optimizations. The project uses OpenGL and GLFW for rendering and window management,
and is written in C++.

The required dependencies are:

- OpenGL (3.3 or higher)
- GLFW (3.4 or higher)
- OpenGL Mathematics (GLM)
- stb_image (v2.29 or higher)

Note that the project might still build successfully with older versions
of the dependencies, though it is recommended to use the latest versions to
avoid any issues.
